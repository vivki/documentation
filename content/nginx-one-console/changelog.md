Stay up-to-date with what's new and improved in the F5 NGINX One Console.

## September 8, 2026

### F5 WAF for NGINX: gRPC protection through the API

You can now configure [gRPC protection]({{< ref "/waf/policies/grpc-protection.md" >}}) for F5 WAF for NGINX policies through the NGINX One Console API. Upload the `.proto` IDL files referenced by a policy's `grpc-profiles` configuration alongside the policy, either as inline base64-encoded content or as a `.tar.gz` archive. For more information, see [Add gRPC protection to a policy]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/grpc-protection-api.md" >}}).

## August 19, 2026

### Instances: Custom display names

You can now assign a display name to an NGINX instance by setting the `display-name` NGINX Agent label. When set, the display name appears alongside the hostname throughout NGINX One Console, and you can filter and sort your instances by display name. For more information, see [Assign a display name to an instance]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/agent/configure-instances/configure-instance-display-name.md" >}}).

## July 16, 2026

### Observability: Zone Filter

You can now filter NGINX instance traffic metrics by configured status zones using the provided dropdown menu on the instance details or metrics screens.

### F5 WAF for NGINX: Built-In Log Profile Support

You can now use built-in F5 WAF for NGINX log profiles as starting points when you create new log profiles. The configuration editor now supports autocomplete for built-in log profile names, making it easier to reference them in a configuration.

### F5 WAF for NGINX: Log Profile Copy Support

You can now copy log profiles from the log profile list. Use row actions to create a copy and extend an existing log profile without overwriting its content.

## June 15, 2026

### F5 WAF for NGINX: Updated policy version names

Policy versions are now numbered sequentially (v1, v2, v3, etc.) instead of using the creation date as the version name. You can also add an optional comment to each version for reference. Existing policy versions now use the new naming scheme.

## June 12, 2026

### Config Explorer

You can now explore any NGINX configuration as an interactive node graph using Config Explorer. Config Explorer is available for Staged Configurations, Instances, and Config Sync Groups.

Key capabilities:

- **Visual node graph**: Browse your entire NGINX configuration hierarchy — including upstreams, servers, and locations — as a navigable graph.
- **Properties panel**: Select any node to view its properties, source file reference, and inline NGINX documentation.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific directives across the entire configuration in real time.

See [Explore configurations with Config Explorer]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/explore-configurations.md" >}}) for more information.

## April 7, 2026

### Observability: F5 WAF for NGINX security dashboard

The new Security Monitoring module gives you real-time visibility into F5 WAF for NGINX security events. You can monitor attack counts, violation types, and triggered signatures across your WAF instances by using customizable dashboards and global filters.

## March 18, 2026

### F5 WAF for NGINX: Log profile management

You can now manage log profiles for F5 WAF for NGINX security logging directly in NGINX One Console. Log profiles control what security events are captured, how they're formatted, and where they're sent.

Key capabilities:

- **Configure log profiles**: Define filtering criteria (all requests, requests with violations, or blocked requests only), select log formats (default, custom, Splunk, ArcSight, or BIG-IQ), and set size limits
- **Manage compiled bundles**: View and compile log profiles for different WAF compiler versions to maintain compatibility across your infrastructure
- **Deploy to instances and Config Sync Groups**: Deploy log profiles to your NGINX instances or Config Sync Groups with automatic compilation for the target's WAF version
- **API support**: Manage log profiles programmatically through the NGINX One Console API

For more information, see [Configure log profiles]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/log-profiles/configure-log-profiles.md" >}}).

## January 27, 2026

### Config Sync Groups: Support for unmanaged certificates

Config Sync Groups now support unmanaged certificates. You can reference SSL/TLS certificates managed outside of NGINX One Console in your configuration files while maintaining centralized configuration synchronization across all instances in the group.

### API behavior change: conf_path is now optional for PUT/PATCH operations

- The `conf_path` field is now optional when updating configurations for NGINX instances, Config Sync Groups, and Staged Configs with PUT and PATCH operations.
- When `conf_path` is omitted, the system automatically uses the `conf_path` from the existing instance, Config Sync Group, or Staged Config metadata.
- When `conf_path` is provided, it must be an absolute path that references a file present in the provided `configs` array. Providing an invalid path or a path not found in the configs returns a `400 Bad Request` error.
- This is a non-breaking change; existing requests that include `conf_path` will continue to work as before.

## November 25, 2025

### Observability: Usage metrics data now available for Config Sync Groups

The Config Sync Group detail page now includes a dashboard containing traffic metrics which mirror those on the Instance detail dashboard. The reported numbers are aggregated from the data reported by the Instances belonging to the Config Sync Group.

### Observability: Network IO now reports Instance or Config Sync Group traffic instead of system traffic

Previously the network IO metrics presented on the Instance detail dashboard represented system-level network traffic, but will now only represent traffic served by NGINX directly. This applies to the new Config Sync Group detail dashboard as well.

### Observability: Disk usage now correctly broken up by mount point

An issue has been fixed with the disk usage data presented on the Instance detail dashboard, and disk usage should now be correctly broken up by mount point in all cases.

## October 22, 2025

### Observability: Network IO is now presented as a rate

For each Instance, you can now review system traffic, in and out, in bits per second. NGINX One Console no longer uses a cumulative value.

## October 7, 2025

### Compare multiple metrics in Instance observability

You can now graph any two metrics simultaneously on one chart within the Metrics tab for each Instance in the NGINX One Console UI.

## October 6, 2025

### Expanded features for configuring NGINX security policies with F5 WAF

You can now configure the following for F5 WAF policies directly in the NGINX One Console:

- [Signature Sets]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/add-signature-sets.md" >}})
- [Signature Exceptions]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/add-signature-sets.md#exceptions" >}})
- [Parameters]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/cookies-params-urls.md#add-parameters" >}})
- [URLs]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/cookies-params-urls.md#add-urls" >}})
- [Cookies]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/policy/cookies-params-urls.md#add-cookies" >}})

For more details, see the [F5 WAF Integration Guide ]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/" >}}).

## October 2, 2025

- Automate with our **experimental** endpoints for [NGINX One Console templates]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/api/api-reference-guide/#tag/Templates" >}})

## September 16, 2025

### IPv6 endpoints for NGINX Agent and NGINX Plus usage reporting

Your instances which run in dual-stack or IPv6-only environments can now communicate with NGINX One Console APIs through IPv6 addresses.
See the [Getting Started Guide]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/getting-started.md#install-nginx-agent" >}}) for the IP address ranges you need to allow in your firewalls.

## July 15, 2025

### Set up F5 WAF for NGINX security policies

You can now incorporate [F5 WAF for NGINX]({{< ref "/waf/" >}}) in NGINX One Console UI. For details, see [Secure with F5 WAF for NGINX]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/waf-integration/" >}}).

In NGINX One Console, you can:

- Toggle between [Default policy bundles]({{< ref "/waf/policies/configuration.md#default-policy" >}})
- Set blocking or transparent [Policy enforcement mode]({{< ref "/waf/policies/configuration.md#policy-enforcement-modes" >}})

### Monitor F5 NGINX Ingress Controller deployments

You can now monitor your NGINX Ingress Controller deployments. For details, see how
you can [Connect to NGINX One Console]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/k8s/add-nic.md" >}}).

Unlike other NGINX instances, when you connect NGINX Ingress Controller to NGINX One Console, access is read-only. Refer to our [NGINX Ingress Controller]({{< ref "/nic/" >}}) for details on how to modify these instances.

## July 1, 2025

### NGINX Agent version 3 support

We have added support for NGINX Agent 3.x in NGINX One Console. You can now:

- Manage data plane instances with NGINX Agent version 3.

## May 19, 2025

### Import and export your Staged Configs

You can now import and export your Staged Configs from the UI and with our APIs. This can help you deploy Staged Configs on the systems of your choice.

## April 30, 2025

### Manage RBAC access with namespaces

We have added support for namespaces in N1C. You can now:

- Manage resources in isolation in different namespaces.
- Configure granular user permission controls base on namespace.

### Alert when CVEs impact registered instances

We now include an alert in the [F5 Distributed Cloud](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/reference/alerts-reference) when affected by one or more CVEs.

### Alert on new registered instances 

We now include an alert in the [F5 Distributed Cloud](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/reference/alerts-reference) when new instances are registered in the F5 NGINX One Console.

## April 3, 2025

### Create Custom Roles with more precise permissions

We have added API groups that align with the features and functionality in the NGINX One Console. You can now:

- Use our narrowly scoped API groups.
- Tailor access policies with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt/roles#custom-roles).

#### Highlights

- Custom role assignments: You can set up custom roles for users or service accounts.
- Namespace-based permissions: With [namespaces](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/platform/concepts/core-concepts#namespaces), you can configure API group permissions to support least privilege.

For more information, read [Custom roles and API groups]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/rbac/rbac-api.md" >}}).

## March 11, 2025

### Set up Staged Configurations

It allows you to:

- Save Your Progress: Staged Configurations allow you to work on configuration changes without the need for a fully functional setup. You can create these drafts from scratch, an existing Instance, another Staged Configuration, or a Config Sync Group.
- No Immediate Validation Required: You don't have to immediately address syntax or configuration issues. Your Staged Configuration doesn't have to be valid until you publish it to an Instance or a Config Sync Group.
- Manage through our API: You can easily manage your Staged Configurations programmatically through our [API]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/api/api-reference-guide/#tag/StagedConfigs" >}}).

## January 20, 2025

### Manage certificates with Config Sync Groups

With the NGINX One Console, you can now manage certificate deployment in Config Sync Groups.

You can:

- Add a certificate to a Config Sync Group
- Remove a deployed certificate from a Config Sync Group

For more information, including warnings about risks, see our documentation on how you can:

- [Add a file]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/one-instance/add-file.md" >}})
- [Manage certificates]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/certificates/manage-certificates.md" >}})

### Revert a configuration

Using the NGINX One Console you can now:

- See a history of changes to the configuration on an instance or a Config Sync Group, as well as the content of the previous five configs published to that object
- Review the differences between the current and other saved configurations
- Revert to older configurations as needed

### F5 AI Assistant

In the F5 NGINX One Console, you can now select lines from your configuration files, and then select **Explain with AI**. The F5 AI Assistant explains those lines based on the official NGINX documentation.

## November 7, 2024

### Certificates

From the NGINX One Console you can now:

- Monitor all certificates configured for use by your connected NGINX Instances.
- Ensure that your certificates are current and correct.
- Manage your certificates from a central location. This can help you simplify operations and remotely update, rotate, and deploy those certificates.

For more information, see the full documentation on how you can [Manage Certificates]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/certificates/manage-certificates.md" >}}).

## August 22, 2024

### Config Sync Groups

Config Sync Groups are now available in the F5 NGINX One Console. This feature allows you to manage and synchronize NGINX configurations across multiple instances as a single entity, ensuring consistency and simplifying the management of your NGINX environment.

For more information, see the full documentation on [Managing Config Sync Groups]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/config-sync-groups/manage-config-sync-groups.md" >}}).

## August 8, 2024

### Instance object cleanup

NGINX Instance objects that have been `unavailable` for a set period will be automatically cleaned up (deleted). By default, this period is 24 hours from the time the NGINX Instance object was last updated. An administrator can change or disable the cleanup process in the "Instance Settings" under Settings. Events will be generated for NGINX Instances that have been automatically cleaned up. See "Events" for a list of NGINX Instances that have been deleted automatically.

## June 11, 2024

### View NGINX security vulnerabilities (CVEs)

You can now view NGINX CVEs on the **Security** page. The listed CVEs affect official releases of NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus.

Select the link for each CVE to see the details, including the CVE's publish date, severity, description, and the affected NGINX products and instances.

## May 29, 2024

### Edit NGINX configurations

You can now make configuration changes to your NGINX instances. For more details, see [View and edit NGINX configurations]({{< ref "/nginx-one-console/nginx-configs/one-instance/view-edit-nginx-configurations.md" >}}).

## May 28, 2024

### Improved data plane key and NGINX instance navigation

We've updated the **Instance Details** and **Data Plane Keys** pages to make it easier to go between keys and registered instances.

- On the **Instance Details** page, you can now find a link to the instance's data plane key. Select the "Data Plane Key" link to view important details like status, expiration, and other registered instances.
- The **Data Plane Keys** page now includes links to more information about each data plane key.

## February 28, 2024

### Breaking change

- API responses now use "object_id" instead of "uuid". For example, **key_1mp6W5pqRxSZJugJN-yA8g**. We've introduced specific prefixes for different types of objects:
  - Use **key\_** for data-plane keys.
  - Use **inst\_** for NGINX instances.
  - Use **nc\_** for NGINX configurations.
- Likewise, we've updated the JSON key from **uuid** to **object_id** in response objects.

## February 6, 2024
