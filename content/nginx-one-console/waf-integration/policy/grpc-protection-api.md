  This page explains how to upload the .proto files a grpc-profiles entry references, using the NGINX One Console API.
  You need this because policy JSON only references IDL files by URI, and the actual file content must be uploaded separately.
  gRPC protection is currently supported through the API only.

F5 WAF for NGINX can protect gRPC APIs by validating messages against their Interface Definition Language (IDL) files (`.proto`). This is configured through the `grpc-profiles` property of a WAF policy.

{{< call-out class="important" >}}
This page covers only how to upload the `.proto` files a `grpc-profiles` entry references through the NGINX One Console API. For a full description of the gRPC protection feature itself (content profiles, defense attributes, URL association, streaming, violations, and logging), see [gRPC protection]({{< ref "/waf/policies/grpc-protection.md" >}}) and the `grpc-profiles` section of the [Policy parameter reference]({{< ref "/waf/policies/parameter-reference.md" >}}).

**gRPC protection is currently supported through the API only.** There is no NGINX One Console UI for configuring `grpc-profiles` or uploading IDL files yet.

{{< call-out class="important" >}}
**Experimental API.** The file reference fields and request bodies described on this page (`file_references`, `file_references_archive`, and related schemas) are under active development. They may change in a future release.
{{< /call-out >}}

## Why file references are needed

A `grpc-profiles` entry's `idlFiles` point at the service's `.proto` file(s) using a `file://` URI, for example:

```json
"idlFiles": [
  {
    "idlFile": { "$ref": "file:///grpc_files/album.proto" },
    "isPrimary": true
  }
]
```

The policy JSON only contains a *reference* to the file. It doesn't contain the file itself. To make the reference resolvable, you must separately upload the actual `.proto` file content in the same API request that creates or updates the policy.

{{< call-out class="note" >}}
**You must explicitly provide the file contents yourself.** NGINX One Console does not fetch, generate, or infer IDL files on your behalf — you own the `.proto` file(s) for your gRPC service, and you are responsible for uploading their exact content every time you create or update a policy version that references them. If a policy version's `file://` reference has no matching uploaded file, the policy will fail to compile.
{{< /call-out >}}

You can upload file references in either of two ways:

- **Inline as base64 JSON**: good for a small number of files, or when you're already sending the policy as JSON.
- **As a `.tar.gz` archive**: good for bundling many files (for example, a primary `.proto` plus its imports) without base64 overhead. Available only when *creating* a policy.

## Upload files as inline JSON (`file_references`)

Send the policy as `application/json` to `POST /app-protect/policies` (create) or `PUT /app-protect/policies/{nap_policy_object_id}` (update a policy, creating a new version), with a `file_references` array alongside the base64-encoded `policy`:

```json
{
  "policy": "<BASE64_ENCODED_POLICY_JSON>",
  "file_references": [
    {
      "type": "proto",
      "file_path": "/grpc_files/album.proto",
      "content": "<BASE64_ENCODED_PROTO_FILE_CONTENT>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry in `file_references` requires:

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `type` | Currently only `proto` is supported. |
| `file_path` | The absolute path matching the `file://` URI referenced in the policy JSON. Must start with `/`. |
| `content` | The base64-encoded file content. |

{{< call-out class="important" >}}
On update (`PUT`), `file_references` **replaces the full set of files** for the new policy version. If you omit `file_references` on an update, the new version is created with **no** file references at all, even if a previous version had files uploaded. Always re-include every file reference the policy still needs when updating.
{{< /call-out >}}

## Upload files as a .tar.gz archive (file_references_archive)

When creating a policy (`POST /app-protect/policies` only, not supported on update), you can instead send `multipart/form-data` with a `policy` field and a `file_references_archive` field containing a gzip-compressed tarball of the referenced files:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nginx-one.console.nginx.com/app-protect/policies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -F "policy=<BASE64_ENCODED_POLICY_JSON>" \
  -F "file_references_archive=@refs.tar.gz;type=application/gzip"
```

The archive's internal directory structure determines the absolute path each file resolves to. Build the archive from the **parent** of the referenced directory so the paths line up with your policy's `file://` URIs:

```
grpc_files/
├── album.proto
└── common/
    └── messages.proto
```

```bash
# Correct: paths resolve to /grpc_files/album.proto, /grpc_files/common/messages.proto
tar czf refs.tar.gz grpc_files/

# Incorrect: paths resolve to /album.proto (missing parent directory)
cd grpc_files && tar czf refs.tar.gz *.proto
```

If your policy references `"$ref": "file:///grpc_files/album.proto"`, the archive must contain `grpc_files/album.proto` at that relative path. Only regular files are extracted. Symlinks, hardlinks, and directory-only entries are ignored.

## Path rules and limits

`file_path` (JSON method) and archive entry paths (multipart method) must:

- Be absolute (start with `/`) and contain no `..` traversal segments.
- Target a directory outside the standard system paths (`/etc`, `/tmp`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/opt`, `/root`, and similar). Use a novel top-level directory such as `/grpc_files` for your referenced files.

| Limit | Inline JSON (`file_references`) | Archive (`file_references_archive`) |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Max size per file | 2 MB | 2 MB (uncompressed) |
| Max total size | 5 MB | 10 MB (uncompressed) / 5 MB (compressed archive) |
| Max number of files | 50 | 100 |

## Retrieving file reference information

`GET` requests for a policy version return **metadata only** for each file reference: `type`, `file_path`, `size`, and a base64-encoded SHA-256 `hash`. They don't return the file's content.

```json
"file_references": [
  {
    "type": "proto",
    "file_path": "/grpc_files/album.proto",
    "size": 4096,
    "hash": "oxiWKPqR/soi4MQCgVnW8KHt8Jk68AqCeQcQ1sed4Dk="
  }
]
```

There is currently no endpoint to download the original file content back from NGINX One Console. Keep a copy of your `.proto` files on your side.

## Full example

The following creates an F5 WAF policy with a `grpc-profiles` entry that references `album.proto`, uploading the file inline as base64 JSON. This mirrors the [example]({{< ref "/waf/policies/grpc-protection.md#content-profiles" >}}) from the gRPC protection feature documentation.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nginx-one.console.nginx.com/app-protect/policies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "policy": "<BASE64_ENCODED_POLICY_JSON>",
    "file_references": [
      {
        "type": "proto",
        "file_path": "/grpc_files/album.proto",
        "content": "<BASE64_ENCODED_PROTO_FILE_CONTENT>"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Decoded `policy` contents:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "name": "my-grpc-service-policy",
    "grpc-profiles": [
      {
        "name": "photo_service_profile",
        "associateUrls": true,
        "defenseAttributes": {
          "maximumDataLength": 100000,
          "allowUnknownFields": false
        },
        "attackSignaturesCheck": true,
        "idlFiles": [
          {
            "idlFile": { "$ref": "file:///grpc_files/album.proto" },
            "isPrimary": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "urls": [
      { "name": "*", "type": "wildcard", "method": "*", "$action": "delete" }
    ]
  }
}
```
