- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS is now running NGINX Plus 37.0 Continuous Releases (CR).**

NGINXaaS for Google Cloud deployments have been automatically upgraded to NGINX Plus 37.0 (PLS.37.0). Please review the [NGINX Plus Release 37.0]({{< ref "/nginx/releases/#pls.37.0.4" >}}) Release Notes carefully for details about NGINX Plus behavioral changes.

Please note the following changes:

- HTTP/1.1 is now the default protocol for connecting to proxy or upstream servers.
- Keepalive connections between NGINX and upstream servers are enabled by default.
- Upstream shared memory zone requires an additional 1KB of memory per upstream server.

NGINX Plus 37.0 (PLS.37.0) introduces new configuration directives and changes to existing directives. NGINXaaS does not support the `ssl_ech_file` directive. For more information, review the unsupported directives listed in [Disallowed configuration directives]({{< ref "/nginxaas/google/deploy/nginx-configuration/configuration-rules/#disallowed-configuration-directives" >}}).

For a complete list of allowed directives, see the [Configuration Directives List]({{< ref "/nginxaas/google/deploy/nginx-configuration/configuration-rules/#configuration-directives-list" >}}).

NGINXaaS also upgraded F5 WAF for NGINX to version 5.13.4. For more information, see the [F5 WAF for NGINX Release Notes]({{< ref "/waf/changelog/#f5-waf-for-nginx-5134" >}}).

You can now deploy NGINXaaS with an internet-facing managed public endpoint.
